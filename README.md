# [NAACL 2024] Self-adaptive Sampling for Efficient Video Question Ansering on Image--Text Models

ðŸ”¥ [14/03/2024] This paper has been accepeted to NAACL 2024 (Findings)!

## Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation code of the paper "[Self-adaptive Sampling for Efficient Video Question Answering on Image--Text Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04192.pdf)". 
In this work we introduce and study two simple sampling strategies (__MIF__ and __MDF__) for the tuning of Video Question Answering tasks on pretrained Visual Language Models (VLMs).

Specifically, we first systematically test the performance of __MIF__ (**M**_ost_ **I**_mplied_ **F**_rames_) with varied backbone models as captioner and scorer. They work together to perform a "question-and-vision-aware" sampling.
Then we draw inspiration from the results and analysis to further propose the more lightweight __MDF__ (**M**_ost_ **D**_ominant_ **F**_rames_), which takes one more step to discard the correlation of question and executs a "question-agnostic, vision-aware" sampling. This routine significantly boosts the efficiency and gains competative or higher performance on the tested datasets.

Once running completes, sampled frames will be saved in a hdf5 (.h5) file as a "dataset" for fast loading during training and test time.
We test our methods on three models (__CLIP__, __GIT__ and __All-in-one__) and 4 datasets (**MSVD-QA**, **MSRVTT-QA**, **TGIF-Frame**, **NeXT-QA**).
The implementation on CLIP (including our refined structure **CLIP-Dec** which significantly enhances the performance on **raw-CLIP**) and GIT are in the folder `clip_and_git`, while the implementation on All-in-one are under the folder `all_in_one`.

## Usage
### 1. Downloading Datasets
Please visit the corresponding repository and follow the instruction there to download the datasets.
- [MSVD and MSRVTT](https://github.com/xudejing/video-question-answering)
- [TGIF](https://github.com/YunseokJANG/tgif-qa)
- [NExT-QA](https://github.com/doc-doc/NExT-QA)

The suggested path to store these datasets is "model/dataset/<dataset_name>" 

### 2. Preprocessing
The code to do sampling for all three models is same, under the folder "clip_and_git/src/preprocessing". 

* To sample via MDF method, run the python script as follows:
    ```
    python extract_features.py --dataset=<dataset_name> --dataset_root=<root_path> --sampling_strategy='repr' --model_name=<vlm_model_name> ... (other hps)
    ```
    If your code prompts an out-of-memory exception, please using a smaller chunksize (default=512) to shrink the input size per computation.

* To sample via MIF method, first run a uniform sampling with large K (e.g., 16 or 32) to obtain a sparse frame sequence

    ```
    python extract_features.py --sampling_strategy='uni' --K 16 ...
    ```
    Then run the python script to capture and start sampling
    ```
    python gen_sample.py --dataset=<dataset_name> --dataset_root=<root_path> --sampling_strategy='repr' --vlm_model=<vlm_model_name> --sim_model=<sim_model_name> --task='gen_cap'

    python gen_sample.py --dataset=<dataset_name> --dataset_root=<root_path> --sampling_strategy='repr' --vlm_model=<vlm_model_name> --sim_model=<sim_model_name> --task='gen_inds'
    ```

### 3. Training and Inference
For experiments on CLIP and GIT, please modify our provided reference scripts (in `src/scripts`). For all-in-one, please check its attached README file for more details.
